## Overview

## 🌎 A Sharkish microblogging platform 🦈🚀 

_Sharkey_ is an Misskey fork following upstream changes when possible, with added features!

### ⚠️ PLEASE READ CAREFULLY ⚠️

**Sharkey** requires **redis** version **7**, but YunoHost does not currently support this version.
Some functions will not be available if you install this package.

I advise you to wait for the release of _Bookworm_ Debian 12.


**Shipped version:** 2024.9.4~ynh1
